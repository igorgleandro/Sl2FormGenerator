# Sl2FormGenerator
Designed for real world use, this project is a form generator that allows users to create the California Due Diligence form , the SL2 Form, by filling out the necessary fields. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. Guding users through the process, the form generator ensures that all required information is collected accurately and efficiently. The generated PDF can be easily downloaded and printed for signature.

I have designed this page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Implemented Bootstrap for responsive design and user-friendly interface and integrated a PDF generation library to create the final document.
